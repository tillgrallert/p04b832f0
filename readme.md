This repository holds supplementary material such as maps, data sets, and code for my essay ‘Urban Food Riots in Late Ottoman Bilād Al-Shām as a “Repertoire of Contention”’, in *Crime, Poverty and Survival in the Middle East and North Africa: The ‘Dangerous Classes’ since 1800*, ed. Stephanie Cronin (London: I.B. Tauris, 2019), 157–76. All materials are licensed as [cc by-nd 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/).

Material is organised in the following folders

- `data/`: data sets on food prices as CSV.
- `maps/`: maps/geo-located data for the cities of Damascus, Hama, and Homs - mostly as GeoJSON.
- `plots/`: plots of time series of various food prices across *Bilād al-Shām*.
- `publication/`: the final plots used for the publication.
- `r/`: R scripts for plotting the price data on a timeline.
